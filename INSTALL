Install process for this module:

The preferred way is with Module::Build, because I'm told all the cool kids
do it that way.*

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

If you wish to install it in a private directory, say this first:

	perl Build.PL config='sitelib=/path/to/my/modules/'


* There's also a Makefile.PL included for folks who don't have Module::Build,
but it's not recommended. Read "MakeMaker Is DOOMED!" for the reason why.
