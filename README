What is "lorem ipsum"?

    "Lorem Ipsum, or Lipsum for short, is simply dummy text of the 
    printing and typesetting industry. Lipsum has been the industry's 
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
    took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    It has survived not only four centuries, but now the leap into 
    electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
    popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets 
    containing Lipsum passages, and more recently with desktop 
    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of 
    Lipsum."  -- lipsum.com
