NAME
    WWW::Lipsum - get autogenerated text from lipsum.com

DESCRIPTION
    "WWW::Lipsum" is a module that will retrive "lorem ipsum" placeholder
    text from lipsum.com.

    What is "lorem ipsum"?

        "Lorem Ipsum, or Lipsum for short, is simply dummy text of the
        printing and typesetting industry. Lipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer
        took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        It has survived not only four centuries, but now the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
        containing Lipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of
        Lipsum."  -- lipsum.com

    lipsum.com is a useful resource on the Web that will generate passages
    of lorem ipsum text for you in sizes of your choice. This module allows
    you to retrieve them in an OO fashion to utilise for whatever purpose
    you wish.

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Lipsum;

        my $lipsum = WWW::Lipsum->new;

        print $lipsum->generate;

        my @paragraphs = $lipsum->generate(
                                           amount => 5,
                                           what   => 'paras',
                                           start  => 'no',
                                           html   => 1
                                          );

METHODS
    There is just one method, "generate", which returns lorem ipsum text. It
    has several options to correspond with those offered by lipsum.com.

        print $lipsum->generate;    # default usage, no options

    This will give you one paragraph of lorem ipsum, beginning with the
    phrase "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet", as is traditional. The size of a
    "paragraph" is randomly determined by the lipsum.com text generator, but
    is generally between 70 and 120 words.

        my @paragraphs = $lipsum->generate(
                                           amount => 5,
                                           what   => 'paras',
                                           start  => 'no',
                                           html   => 0
                                          );

    This will give you five paragraphs of lorem ipsum, the first of which
    will be without the starting phrase. Setting 'html' to 1 will cause each
    paragraph to be wrapped in HTML's <p></p> tags.

        print $lipsum->generate(
                                amount => 100,
                                what   => 'words'
                               );

    This will give you a hundred words of lorem ipsum with the starting
    phrase. The 'html' setting has no effect if you ask for words. When used
    to fill a variable, this will give you a list with one item.

        print $lipsum->generate(
                                amount => 1024,
                                what   => 'bytes'
                               );

    This will give you 1024 bytes of lorem ipsum with the starting phrase.
    Again, the 'html' setting will have no effect. Again, this will give you
    a one-item list.

       my @lists = $lipsum->generate(
                                     amount => 10,
                                     what   => 'lists',
                                     html   => 1
                                    );

    The lipsum.com text generator's 'lists' setting produces HTML lists of
    random size. Using this setting with this module will give you small
    chunks of text, generally of the order of a couple of sentences. Using
    the 'html' setting will cause these chunks to be wrapped in <li></li>
    tags for you to use as you see fit. If 'html' is off, you will get
    blocks of single lines of text.

OLD METHOD NAMES
    The "generate" method used to be called "lipsum"; this is retained as an
    alias to "generate" if you really want it.
