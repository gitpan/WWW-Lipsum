            * James Wilson (who made lipsum.com) got in touch with me to say that
              he'd altered the output of the site. Here's what he wrote:
                                                                                                                         
                I notice that you seek through a few tables in order to                                                  
                find the lipsum, and with advertising etc, that's not                                                    
                going to be very reliable, so I've enclosed the lipsum                                                   
                and generated lines in div tags with ids of lipsum and                                                   
                generated respectively. Check the source of an output                                                    
                page for a little waffle about these tags:                                                               
                                                                                                                         
                http://www.lipsum.com/?what=paras&amount=5&start=1                                                       
                                                                                                                         
                Something else I'll ask of you if possible... rather than 
                submit to the root to retrieve the output, could you 
                please submit to /feed/http, as I might add an XML 
                interface etc in the future, and so I currently plan to 
                use /feed/xml and /feed/http etc.
                
                Hope that info helps you modify your Perl module and that                                                
                the div tags will give you a consistent way of harvesting                                                
                the lipsum without it being affected by my layout. 
                
              I've modified the module appropriately, as well as cleaned 
              up the code a bit. Also, the "lipsum" method is now called 
              "generate", but the old name is retained as an alias.

            * Fixed a bug that caused spurious paragraphs - the lipsum.com text
              generator puts a rogue newline after the starting phrase, which was
              breaking the parsing and causing one of tests to fail.

            * Initial release.
