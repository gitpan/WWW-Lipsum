            - James Wilson (who made lipsum.com) got in touch with me to say that
              he'd altered the output of the site. Here's what he wrote:

                I notice that you seek through a few tables in order to
                find the lipsum, and with advertising etc, that's not
                going to be very reliable, so I've enclosed the lipsum
                and generated lines in div tags with ids of lipsum and
                generated respectively. Check the source of an output
                page for a little waffle about these tags:

                http://www.lipsum.com/?what=paras&amount=5&start=1

                Something else I'll ask of you if possible... rather than
                submit to the root to retrieve the output, could you
                please submit to /feed/http, as I might add an XML
                interface etc in the future, and so I currently plan to
                use /feed/xml and /feed/http etc.

                Hope that info helps you modify your Perl module and that
                the div tags will give you a consistent way of harvesting
                the lipsum without it being affected by my layout.

              I've modified the module appropriately, as well as cleaned
              up the code a bit. Also, the "lipsum" method is now called
              "generate", but the old name is retained as an alias.

            - Fixed a bug that caused spurious paragraphs - the lipsum.com text
              generator puts a rogue newline after the starting phrase, which was
              breaking the parsing and causing one of tests to fail.
